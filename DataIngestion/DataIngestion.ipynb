       "'Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) Basar is unique university which actively uses Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in teaching. It is perhaps the first of its kind in the country with an educational model that is intensely ICT based. Established by the Government of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh vide a special act of legislation, this campus is loacated at the holy land of Basar (the abode of Gnyana Saraswathi, Goddess of knowledge) in Nirmal District (Telangana State). The campus is set in about 272 acres of salubrious and serene surrounding just a short distance from the banks of river Godavari.\\n\\nThe primary objective of establishing RGUKT is to provide high quality educational opportunities for the rural youth of the state. The selection process follows approved rules and has very high competition where only the top rural graduates (mostly within the top 5%) get the opportunity to study at RGUKT.\\n\\nThe University houses about 6000 students along with 250 faculty members and 120 support staff within its campus. The residential university comprises of Academic blocks with more than 140 ICT equipped classrooms, well – equipped laboratories, libraries with more than 1,00,000 volumes, boys’ and girls’ hostels and mess blocks that provide quality and nutritious food. The campus is more or less self-sustained with a Laundromat, bank, ATM, Shopping Complex, post office, primary health center etc. It also has indoor and outdoor recreational facilities, well equipped gymnasium, courts for basketball, badminton, table tennies, cricket, other sports and games.\\n\\nRGUKT has slowly but surely risen in reputation as its graduating engineers have acted as perfect brand ambassadors for the university. Batches of engineers graduated from RGUKT are placed in various companies, Government services and public sector. Some of them have also set up their own business and ventures as entrepreneurs. The metamorphosis of these students from reticent youngsters unsure of themselves into professionals rubbing shoulders with the best is a matter of great satisfaction and also a testimony to the founding principles of the University.'"

However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI such as cybercrime, the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people, and the mass replacement of human jobs.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Since its inception, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automatons has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet\\'s automaton created in the early 1800s.\\nArtificial Intelligence is an idea that has been captivating society since the mid-20th century. It began with science fiction familiarizing the world with the concept but the idea was not fully seen in the scientific manner until Alan Turing, a polymath, was curious about the feasibility of the concept. Turing\\'s ground-breaking 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" posed fundamental questions about machine reasoning similar to human intelligence, significantly contributing to the conceptual groundwork of AI. The development of AI was not very rapid at first because of the high costs and the fact that computers were not able to store commands. This changed during the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI where there was an inspiring call for AI research, setting the precedent for two decades of rapid advancements in the field.\\nSince the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nMarkov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal.

The event catalyzed the AI boom later that decade, when many alumni of the ImageNet challenge became leaders in the tech industry. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, the first time a computer Go program has beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. This match led to significant increase of public interest in AI. The generative AI race began in earnest in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of OpenAI and earlier advances made in graphical processing units (GPUs), the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models and transformer architectures. In 2018, the Artificial Intelligence Index, an initiative from Stanford University, reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in AI. Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by China and North America. Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and improved the process of drug development. Economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of AI more frequently. By 2022, large language models (LLMs) saw increased usage in chatbot applications; text-to-image-models could generate images that appeared to be human-made; and speech synthesis software was able to replicate human speech efficiently.\\nAccording to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranks the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, the number of startups, and patents granted in AI. Scientists who have immigrated to the U.S. play an outsize role in the country\\'s development of AI technology. Many of them were educated in China, prompting debates about national security concerns amid worsening relations between the two countries.\\nExperts have framed AI development as a competition for economic and geopolitical advantage between the United States and China. In 2021, an analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations outlined ways that the U.S. could maintain its position amid progress made by China. In 2023, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies advocated for the U.S. to use its dominance in AI technology to drive its foreign policy instead of relying on trade agreements.\\n\\n\\n== Advances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biomedical ===\\nThere have been proposals to use AI to advance radical forms of human life extension.\\nThe AlphaFold 2 score of more than 90 in CASP\\'s global distance test (GDT) is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology. Nobel Prize winner and structural biologist Venki Ramakrishnan called the result \"a stunning advance on the protein folding problem\", adding that \"It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted.\"\\nThe ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases. It went on to note that the AI algorithm could \"predict the shape of proteins to within the width of an atom.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Images and videos ===\\n\\nText-to-image models captured widespread public attention when OpenAI announced DALL-E, a transformer system, in January 2021. A successor capable of generating complex and realistic images, DALL-E 2, was unveiled in April 2022. An alternative text-to-image model, Midjourney, was released in July 2022. Another ')]"
